			<header>Intro</header>
			<p>The mission behind this site is to clarify the generosity behind Pokemon X/Y's Wonder Trade System.</p>
			<p>I ran a little experiment on 10/26/2013 to see what types of pokemon I got back.</p>
			<p>So if you got an Eevee with a ____ that day, its very likely you were part of my experiment (thanks!)</p>

		<p>So I broke this project into four parts...</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Breed a boat load of Eevees.<sub>Eevee is a pretty cool dude, so I bred 300 of him. I biked between Camphrier Town and Connecting Cave picking up eggs and from the day care as often as I could. I had a Talonflame in the front of my party (for the flame body bonus), and was constantly running the hatching o-power (with a level 4 recharge rate).</sub></li>
			<li>Develop this sweet webapp.</li>
			<li>Record the data <sub>On Saturday 10/26/2013 I wonder traded 300 Eevees carrying Balm Mushrooms and recorded what I got back</sub></li>
			<li>Analyze and disseminate the data <sub>Thats right, if you are interested in learning more, feel free to checkout the raw json file</sub></li>
